Media Scraper
=============

Python script for playing all media on tagesschau.de with a single click


I always imagined how nice it would be, if I got up and only needed a single click to enjoy my news during breakfast. Well the time has come that my dream came true. If you want feel free to join me :)


INSTALLATION
============

You might need to download urllib, cookielib and/or BeautifulSoup. You can do this with easy_install and pip.

RUN
===

Run this code with python2!
This code is not compatible with python3 (mainly because I had issues with the cookielib and didn't bother to waste too much time dealing with them).

LICENSE
=======

I am happy if you want to use my code (or parts of it) in your project. So if you do, please contact me first before publishing your code!
